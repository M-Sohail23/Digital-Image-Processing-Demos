## Introduction

The DIPP Lab repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with digital image processing techniques. It includes multiple filters and processing methods, especially focusing on frequency domain transformations. These tools are essential for tasks such as image enhancement, noise reduction, and feature extraction.

## Notebooks

1. **Image Transformation.ipynb**
   - Applies various geometric and intensity transformations to images.
   - Techniques include scaling, rotation, translation, and histogram equalization.

2. **Multiple Filters.ipynb**
   - Demonstrates the application of multiple spatial filters.
   - Includes filters like Gaussian, Median, Sobel, and Laplacian.

3. **Frequency Domain Processing.ipynb**
   - Covers frequency domain techniques for image processing.
   - Commands for Fourier Transform, Inverse Fourier Transform, and frequency domain filtering.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:
